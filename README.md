# Regular update on projects:

## 0. Theme of this project

- This project focuses on exploring the habit of phone usages (inclusing phone's applications, duration of using, ...)

- Due to some technical problems regarding the data extraction from phone -> Probably the project will focus on a person's usage of data


## 1. Data preparation

- The phone usage data is saved by Wellbeing (as in the Android):
https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/230211/how-to-export-phone-usage-time-data-to-json-csv-sql-txt-raw-form

- Currently, we have 2 choices:

### 1.1 App Usage
- A table of Application - Date - Time - Usage Duration
- A table of total amount of time for each application (not interesting, could be processed from the above table)

### 1.2 ActionDash
- Also take the data from Wellbeing, different visualization


### Conclusion:

Currently, we use the table obtained from App Usage to visualize the data

## 2. Visualization with D3
